# Question Mark

The question mark, ```?```, can be used as if statement when paired with ```:```.

The format should be like:
> Condition ```?``` Value if True ```:``` Value if False

```javascript
// If weather is over 30, then weatherState is "hot weather"
// If weather is less than 30, then weatherState is "cold weather"
const weatherState = weather > 30 ? "hot weather" : "cold weather"
```
